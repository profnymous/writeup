# Learning Reverse Engineering

This repository is a write-up of my journey learning Reverse Engineering (RE). My goal is to document what I learn along the way and, hopefully, provide a resource that's helpful to others interested in the same field.

Here, you’ll find notes, examples, and insights as I progress through various RE techniques and tools.

Feel free to follow along or contribute if you’d like to share your own insights. Let's learn together!
